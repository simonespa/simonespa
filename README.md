### Hi there 👋

My name is Simone and I work at the BBC as a Software Engineer Team Lead in the Sounds web team.

I'm a full time dad 🍼 with a passion for music: from playing it to listent to it. I love technology and digital content creation as well as taking my bike out for a ride, no matter where.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on making [BBC Sounds](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds) a Single-Page web application with a persistent player. Read my [Medium article](https://medium.com/bbc-product-technology/sounds-web-next-a-persistent-player-prototype-for-bbc-sounds-bf996ef0c332) about it.
- 🌱 I’m currently dipping my toe into Machine Learning and I'm enrolled for a level 7 apprenticeship in [AI and Data Science](https://www.cambridgespark.com/data-apprenticeships/level-7-ai-data-science)
- 💬 Get in touch if you think that I may be able to help you out or advice about something.
