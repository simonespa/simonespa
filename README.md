### Hello

👋 My name is Simone Spaccarotella and I work at the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk) as a Software Engineer Team Lead for the Sounds web team. My team is currently busy making [BBC Sounds](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds) a Single-Page web application with a persistent player (read my [Medium article](https://medium.com/bbc-product-technology/sounds-web-next-a-persistent-player-prototype-for-bbc-sounds-bf996ef0c332) about it).

🎓 I graduated from the "[Università della Calabria](https://www.unical.it)" some time ago but I'm still studying and learning new stuff to these days. I started working at the BBC in 2014 with the Graduate Scheme, fast forward February 2023 I started a level 7 (MSc) Staff Apprenticeship in [AI and Data Science](https://www.cambridgespark.com/data-apprenticeships/level-7-ai-data-science) which I completed in March 2025.

❤️ I'm a full-time dad 🍼 with a passion for music (listening 🎧 and producing 🪗🎹🎸🎤). I love technology and digital content creation as well as taking my bike 🚴🏼 out for a ride, no matter the road surface.
